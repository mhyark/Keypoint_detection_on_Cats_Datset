# Keypoint_detection_on_Cats_Datset

# Description
In this assignment you have to build and train a cat eyes and nose keypoint detector model using tf.keras. We will use an autoencoder like architecture, which first encodes the data, then decodes it to its original size. To implement such kind of models, you should take a look at the following classes and methods: Funcitonal API, MaxPooling2D, Conv2DTranspose.
